Feature: heroku_san can control a project on Heroku
  WARNING: This WILL create apps on Heroku!
  You must login with the heroku cli before starting
  this test; otherwise it will probably hang the first
  time it tries to do anything with Heroku itself.

  Scenario: Installing on a project
    Given I have a new Rails project
    When I am in the project directory
    And I add heroku_san to the Gemfile
    And I run bundle install
    Then rake reports that the heroku: tasks are available
